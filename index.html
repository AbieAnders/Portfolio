      <h2>üòº About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science major at Easwari Engineering College, currently in my fourth year. I find everything
        about computers exciting and always want to learn more about how they work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy playing and watching tactically oriented games. Football is a personal favorite of mine. I also love
        professional chess and esports like CS2, Dota 2 and Deadlock.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy stories with lore-oriented narratives. My favorite genres are fantasy and sci-fi. I seek out media with
        a lot of artistic expression and find myself appreciating stories more when people can have different
        experiences with them.

      <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>
      <p><strong>Billing software:</strong> A react.js based billing user interface with a fast backend written using
        Golang's Fiber framework and a scalable PostgreSQL database. It follows a RESTful API approach and uses
        security-oriented programming practices. Json Web Tokens(JWT) are used for stateless user authentication.</p>
      <p><strong>Java E-Commerce Website:</strong> A robust e-Commerce website designed using the MVC architecture with
        Java servlets, JSP pages, DAO, and a MySQL database. It uses session-based authentication to authorize product
        ordering and cancellation.</p>
      <p><strong>OCR Model:</strong> An OCR deep neural network was trained using PyTorch and the IAM_Words dataset,
        capable of reading handwritten text as images and providing the exact words with satisfactory accuracy.</p>
      <p><strong>Android Calculator App:</strong> A simple Android application built using the Android Studio IDE, Java
        for the controller, and XML for the view.</p>
      <p><strong>Web Scraper:</strong> A web scraper that honors robots.txt, rotates between Tor circuits, uses a
        selenium web driver, and creates a random user agent to scrape websites like Amazon and Aaj Tak news.</p>
      <p><strong>Flappy Bird Clone:</strong> A functional clone of the classic game 'Flappy Bird' created using the Java
        framework 'Processing.'</p>
      <p><strong>React Todo List:</strong> A simple Todo List app built with React.js, featuring session-based storage
        and a minimal design to keep users focused on tasks.</p>
      <p><strong>Message classifier Bot:</strong> A bot that reads WhatsApp messages, categorizes them using Hugging
        Face's Zero-Shot Classification, and uploads them to a Discord channel.</p>
      <p><strong>API Transliteration:</strong> A tool to transliterate input text into different languages using various
        free APIs, with a minimal Streamlit UI.</p>
      <p><strong>MS Word Text Translator:</strong> A Python program to read and translate Word file contents using the
        'translatepy' library.</p>
      <p><strong>Gender Classification Model:</strong> A model to determine gender based on speech-related acoustic
        parameters.</p>
      <p><strong>Movie Recommender System:</strong> A machine learning-based recommendation system listing the five most
        similar movies to a given movie.</p>
      <p><strong>CPU Simulator [Ongoing]:</strong> A top-down simulator for the Intel 8008 microprocessor, including a
        working ALU and instruction encoder/decoder.</p>
      <p><strong>Top Down Space Shooter [Ongoing]:</strong> A space-themed shooter game with unique mechanics and deep
        skill progression.</p>
